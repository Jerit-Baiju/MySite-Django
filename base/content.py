HISTORY = [
    "In 2016, when I was in 4th grade and 10 years old, my parents bought me a laptop. I was ecstatic about it! I quickly learned how to control the cursor and type with ease using MS-Paint and Notepad.",
    "At 11, I began playing Microsoft's mini-games like Chess, Minesweeper, and others, and learned MS-Logo. I created numerous objects and enjoyed experimenting with them.",
    "At 12, I joined an activity on Photoshop and Animation using Adobe Flash-Macromedia. As I explored the computer in my school, I stumbled upon an HTML file and became intrigued. Curious about its purpose, I approached my teacher, Reshmi Miss, and asked about it. She kindly taught me some basics of HTML, sparking my interest in programming.",
    "At 13, I built my own website using HTML exclusively and subsequently discovered other programming languages such as C++, Python, and JavaScript.",
    "At 14, I created my own chatbot using Visual Basic and independently upgraded my computer from Windows 7 to Windows 10. I began learning Python and developed simple command-line applications, as well as GUI applications for Windows using Tkinter.",
    "At 15, I transitioned to Linux and expanded my skills by learning CSS, JavaScript, GIT, and Flask. I published my website on PythonAnywhere, which unfortunately is currently unavailable. I completed numerous projects including a ChatBot named Clara and a Weather app, among others.",
    "At 16, I acquired proficiency in Django and deployed my website on HEROKU. Additionally, I developed a package called PYFLIT for FLASK users and learned some other languages like Go, R, CPP and Java. ",
    "At 17, I upgraded my setup with a MacBook Air M1, funded by my first freelancing project. This marked my entry into the Apple ecosystem, replacing an old Ubuntu laptop. I optimized my website by deploying it on AWS, and expanded my skills with React.js, Next.js, Tailwind, and TypeScript, adding versatility to my web development expertise.",
    "At 18 (present), I'm navigating towards new horizons in my journey. Aiming to secure a job, I'm strategically honing my skills and exploring opportunities. Embracing growth, I continue to leverage my expertise while maintaining a forward-looking approach. The focus this year revolves around professional development, aligning with my goal of advancing in the ever-evolving tech landscape.",
